*******************
Run virtual machine
*******************

To run our first virtual machine, we stick with the easy-to-use Sunstone web UI.

In the left tab, click on **Instances → VMs** to get a (currently empty) list of running virtual machines. Click on the plus button **[+]** to start a new one.

Select the prepared template of "CentOS 7". (Please note the initial template already has network interface preconfigured in the "Network" section below. If you later import additional appliances from the Marketplace or your own, you will need to assign the network interface to them).

Click on the **Create** button to start the virtual machine.

When we go back to the list of virtual machines in **Instances → VMs**, we can see our new machine. If the virtual machine is still not in RUNNING, click the button with refresh icon to reload the data.

When the virtual machine is running, the "display" icon allows to open a graphical console. Login as user **root** with default password **opennebula** (can be changed in miniONE advanced deployment, see below).

You can validate the virtual machine can reach the public internet services. E.g.:

|images-sunstone-vm-vnc|

While being logged on your frontend under **root** or **oneadmin** user, you can login your virtual machine over SSH. The IP address of the virtual machine is visible in the virtual machines list. For example, for 172.16.100.2 try

.. code-block:: bash

    # ssh root@172.16.100.2
    Warning: Permanently added '172.16.100.2' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
    Last login: Mon May 20 14:16:55 2019 from 172.16.100.1
    [root@localhost ~]#

To terminate the virtual machine, go back to the Sunstone web UI to **Instances → VMs**. Select the particular virtual machine and click on the trash button to terminate it.
